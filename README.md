Screensaver heavily inspired by Fuzzyflakes, there wasn't alot of documentation on the screensaver header so I just stiched together existing screensaver guide and got a solid template through that. 
I added no sliders since I tailored this to my own style, it also can flicker a little and the layer initializing doesnt immediatly happen. I don't know where it failed but it is a minor issue, maybe will fix in the future whenever I feel like.

My C++ coding skills are lack luster. I did heavily depend on stackoverflow snippets, I did use Ai to write layer 3 because I saw no point repeating what I already did tidiously.

If you want to use it, the .hpkg is on the release page. 

# Building

The dependecies are <b>make</b> and <b>libc<b> to build run:
<code>make install</code>

It should be automaticly placed in your screensaver folder!
